    <description>
      <p class="flavor">"It is better to die with a sword in your hand than live with a scar on your back, for that is the brand of a coward", this is the creed of the warrior women known as Amazons.</p>
	  <p class="indent">Amazons live in secret islands, valleys, or other secluded places. They hunt and forage for food, train for whatever danger may arise, and defend their homes and sisters from monsters and beasts.</p>
      <h4>PERSONALITY</h4>
      <p>Amazons are quick to act, feeling that talking will often confuse the situation when their gut has already given them the answer they need. They are quick to distrust all outsiders, especially men, though given time, they will develop friendships outside of their own race.<br /> <span class="indent"></span>They rarely travel outside their homeland but it is not unheard of. Those that do are either compelled by curiosity of the outside word, sent out by their Matriarch, or exiled.</p>
      <h4>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION</h4>
      <p>Amazons are large, well-built humanoids with powerful builds. They are entirely female, and most races find them beautiful.<br /> <span class="indent" />Their skin colors are as varied as humans', ranging from dark-skinned to borderline albino.<br /> <span class="indent" /></p>
      <h4>RELATIONS</h4>
      <p>Amazons are highly reclusive and don't take well to interlopers in their lands, treating them with hostility or aggression.<br /> <span class="indent" />Trade with neighboring cultures primarily consists of bartering with whatever they have.</p>
      <h4>ALIGNMENT</h4>
      <p>As amazons spend a lot of time at the mercy of nature, they tend toward neutrality. However, the law of their culture is also very important to them, for it is those few doctrines that uphold their fragile civilization.</p>
      <h4>LANGUAGE</h4>
      <p>Sylvan is the language of choice among amazons, who may have learned it from their forest dwelling fey neighbors whom they share land with. Though, when dealing with humans and other races for trading, they do speak Common, although it is rather rough do to lack of practice.</p>
	  <h4>AMAZON NAMES</h4>
      <p>Amazonian names draw primarily from the ancient Greek and as such Latin naming schemes. Xanathar's Guide to Everything has a section that gives the player a roll-able table of 50 female Greek names on page 186.</p>

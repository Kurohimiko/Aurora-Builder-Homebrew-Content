    <description>
      <p>You touch the ground or another solid surface. Until the end of your next turn, you can detect vibrations in the environment.</p>
      <p class="indent">By sensing vibrations in the ground, you can perceive your surroundings as precisely as normal sight, and in some cases with even greater clarity. You are able to detect things that are barely visible or even invisible to the naked eye as well as things out of your line of sight.</p>
	  <p class="indent">Obstacles that would normally obstruct regular vision, such as walls and thick dust clouds, are rendered ineffective against seismic sense. As the vibrations travel underground, they enable you to effectively detect subterranean cavities.</p>
	  <p class="indent">As a side effect you are able to discern whether or not spoken words are falsehoods. Omissions, evasions, and false claims are undetectable. The target must succeed a Charisma (Deception) saving throw or be caught lying.</p>

			<p>This weapon is inspired by the common farming implement used to cut swaths of grown hay, but it has a straight handle and a heavier blade. Despite its humble origins, the scythe is recognized as a symbol of death in many cultures because of its use in reaping. Rather than being too heavy for most smaller creatures, the scythe is too long for Small sized creatures to wield effectively. </p>
